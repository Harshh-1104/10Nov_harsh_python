django notes

what is framework?
Definition of Framework (in coding language)

A framework is a collection of pre-written code, libraries, tools, and conventions that provides a 
standard structure for developing software applications, where the framework controls the program 
flow and the developer writes code according to its rules.

A framework is a ready-made structure that helps you build software faster and in an organized way.

first import .models import *
admin.site.register(tablename)

for getting data from frontend create forms.py  in app which is builtin library in django
-for django validation and html form handling 
also import * from models



<form method="post">
cross site request forgery    ->part of security 
{% csrf_token %}                  ->tamplate tag          write this exact under form method

for frontend to backend connecting in input type write also write column name attribute   -> 						                  name="dob"           
				                  name="email"
in their tag	

in forms.py for validating req
class justanyname(forms.modelform):
class meta:
         model=tablename
         fields='__all__'             for selecting which column 
         

in view.py   app
print(form.errors)        ->bcz we dont know wht error is


for view 
tablename.objects.


same name as model u have to write in html part




create static folder for css js

css always comes in head part of html
and change path /static/lib/....

go to settings.py 
static url
copy the link tht we get from staticfile url link
staticfiles_dirs=[
base_dir/"static"
]


js comes in last part of body

and remove .html 

replace css/
with /static/css/
